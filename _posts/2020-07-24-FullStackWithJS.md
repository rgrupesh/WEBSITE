JavaScript has come long way in the last 20 years. JavaScript engine were orginally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded even in some servers, usually via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). This evolution has made JavaScript a universal language.<br>

<h2>Whai is Full Stack Web Development?</h2>
Full Stack is the development of both Front end/Client-side and Back end/Server-side. Full Stack Web Development can be divided into three major layers: Presentation layer, Business logic layer, and Data access layer. Presentation layer handles UI/UX, Business logic layer deals with dyanamic data processing, and Data access layer provides data acesss through API.<br>

<h2>How to Become a Full Stack Web Developer?</h2>
Firstly, developer should have knowladge of front end technologies like Bootstrap, Javascript, React, Angular or Vue in addition to HTML and CSS. Secondly, they should be equally good with backend tools like Node.js, Django, Express and language like Python, JavaScript, ASP.NET, Java, C++, PHP. Finally, they should have knowladge of database like SQL, MYSQL, SQLite  or MongoDB.<br>

Further, a full stack developer can specialize into one or many software stack.<br>
1: MEAN Stack: MONGO | EXPRESS | ANGULAR| NODE<br>
2: MERN Stack: MONGO | EXPRESS | REACT| NODE<br>
3: MEVN Stack: MONGO | EXPRESS | VUE | NODE<br>
4: LAMP Stack: LINUX | APACHE | MYSQL | PHP<br>
5: Django Stack: JAVASCRIPT | PYTHON | DJANGO | MYSQL<br>

<h2>Javascript Full Stack</h2>
Learning various languages can be cumbersome at times. This is where JavaScript comes in. In javascript full stack, presentaion layer can be built using JavaScript frameworks, such as: React, angular or Vue. Similarly, business logic layer is constructed with Node.js and node-modules to communicate with front end using rest API serving JSON. Finally, MongoDB is used in data access layer.
There's tradeoff everywhere. Full Stack Web Dev is no exception. <br>

The pros and cons of JavaScript full stack are as follows:
<h3>Pros</h3><br>
Prototype can be build rapidly.<br>
Common language, better team efficiency with less resources<br>
Code reuse<br>
Can switch between front and back end development based on requirements<br>

<h3>cons</h3><br>
Heavy computation and data processing, node.js not recommended <br>
Really hard to master all aspects of web dev. Jack of all trades, master of none?<br>
