NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an genentic algorithm that creates artificial neural network. It works on the basis of natural selection.
As Darwin says,"Survival of the fittest".


Bascially, there are five steps in this algorithm:
<ol>
  <li>Initial population</li>
      Create a population of birds(say 100).
  <li>Fitness function<li>
      This function gives point to birds if they pass certain thershold.       
  <li>Collection of best<li>
      And then, we select best performers.
  <li>And mutate<li>
      Mutate them to make them even better.
</ol>  

  <h1>Pseudo Code</h1>
  START
  Generate the initial population
  Compute fitness
  REPEAT
      Selection
      Crossover
      Mutation
      Compute fitness
  UNTIL population has converged
  STOP

  <h2>Training Neural Network</h2>

  First, position of bird, postion of both pipe(up and down) from bird as a input to the neural network.Second Activation function tanH. random weight and bias. Output is to jump or not(certain condition).
