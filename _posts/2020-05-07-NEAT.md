NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an genentic algorithm that creates artificial neural network. It works on the basis of natural selection.<br>

As Darwin says,"Survival of the fittest".


Bascially, there are five steps in this algorithm:
<ol>
  <li>Initial population</li>
      Create a population of birds(say 100).
  <li>Fitness function</li>
      This function gives point to birds if they pass certain thershold.       
  <li>Collection of best</li>
      Selection of best performers.
  <li>And mutate</li>
      Mutate them to make them even better.
</ol>  

  <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Pseudo Code</h1><br>
  START<br>
  Generate the initial population<br>
  Compute fitness<br>
  <dl><dt>REPEAT</dt>
        <dd>Selection</dd>
        <dd>Crossover</dd>
        <dd>Mutation</dd>
        <dd>Compute fitness</dd></dl>
    UNTIL population has converged<br>
  STOP

  First, position of bird, postion of both pipe(up and down) from bird as a input to the neural network.Second Activation function tanH. random weight and bias. Output is to jump or not(certain condition).
