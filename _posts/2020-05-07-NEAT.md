NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an genentic algorithm that creates artificial neural network. It works on the basis of natural selection.<br>

As Darwin says,"Survival of the fittest".


<h2>Bascially, there are five steps in this algorithm:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Initial population</li>
      Create a population of birds(say 100).
  <li>Fitness function</li>
      This function gives point to birds if they pass certain thershold.       
  <li>Collection of best</li>
      Selection of best performers.
  <li>And mutate</li>
      Mutate them to make them even better.
</ol>  

  <h2>Pseudo Code</h2><br>
  <dl>
  <dt>START</dt><br>
  <dt>Generate the initial population</dt><br>
  <dt>Compute fitness</dt><br>
  <dt>REPEAT</dt>
        <dd>Selection</dd>
        <dd>Crossover</dd>
        <dd>Mutation</dd>
        <dd>Compute fitness</dd>
  <dt>UNTIL population has converged</dt><br>
  <dt>STOP

  <h2>Training Neural Network</h2> <br>

  First, position of bird, postion of both pipe(up and down) from bird as a input to the neural network.Second Activation function tanH. random weight and bias. Output is to jump or not(certain condition).
