NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is an genentic algorithm that creates artificial neural network. It works on the basis of natural selection.<br>



As Darwin says,"Survival of the fittest".

<h2>Bascially, there are four steps in this algorithm:</h2>
   <ol><dl><dt><li>Initial population</li></dt>
    <dd>Create a population of birds(say 100).</dd>
  <dt><li>Fitness function</li></dt>
   <dd>This function gives point to birds if they pass certain thershold.</dd>       
  <dt><li>Collection of best</li></dt>
   <dd>Selection of best performers.</dd>
  <dt><li>And mutate</li></dt>
   <dd>Mutate them to make them even better.</dd>
</dl>
</ol>

<h2>Training Neural Network</h2><br>

The position of bird, postion of both pipe(up and down) with respect bird is taken as a input to the neural network. The Weight and Bias are randomly initialized, and get better along with the training. Activation function(TanH) excites the neurons.  Output is to jump or not(certain condition).
